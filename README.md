# Agiledata

## Introduction

Agiledata is a simple tool for showing your project's tasks. It has been built from the need to have some statistics
while using the whiteboard as a primary tool for tracking the tasks.

The tool is available in [https://agiledata.herokuapp.com](https://agiledata.herokuapp.com).
